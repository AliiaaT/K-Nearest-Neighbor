# Mini-project: k-NN

The goal is to implement the k-NN classiﬁer. The program should take 3 arguments:

k: positive natural being the k-NN hiperparameter

train-set: name of the ﬁle containing csv train set

test-set: name of the ﬁle containing csv test set

The program should apply k-NN classiﬁer based on the train set to each vector from

the test set and produce the accuracy (proportion of correctly classiﬁed examples from

the test set).

The program should additionally provide a simple interface (not necessarily graphical)

to make it possible to input single vectors by the user to be classiﬁed.

Optional extension: prepare a graph (excel, python, etc.) showing the accuracy vs the

value of k.

Test the program using training data in iris.data and test data in iris.test.data

(but the program should be able to load other datasets).
